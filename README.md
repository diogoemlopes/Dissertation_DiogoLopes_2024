The testing and evaluation is conducted using two distinct scenarios.

In the folder "0.Implementation_V2", the first scenario serves as a baseline, where the agent operates under normal conditions without any additional challenges. 

In the folder "0.Implementation_V3", the second scenario, a critical event is introduced by forcing the disconnection of a crucial power line at time step 0.
This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of the agent's behaviour, decision making, reliability and network management capabilities under normal and fault conditions.


To run the code contained in the folders, it is necessary to import the libraries used and change the path of the folders to those used by the end user.
